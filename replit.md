### Duplicate Employee Prevention with Optimistic Cache Updates (October 20, 2025)
- **Critical Fix - Duplicate Employee Prevention**: Resolved issue where rapid clicks created multiple duplicate employees
  - **Problem**: User clicking "Accepter" multiple times created 4-5 identical employee records
  - **Root Cause**: Buttons reappeared after processing because `invalidateQueries()` doesn't force immediate UI refresh
  - **Solution**: Implemented optimistic cache updates with `queryClient.setQueryData()`
  - Implementation details:
    - **Optimistic Update in `onMutate`**:
      - `queryClient.cancelQueries()` - Cancels in-flight queries to avoid conflicts
      - `queryClient.getQueryData()` - Snapshots current state for rollback
      - `queryClient.setQueryData()` - **Immediately updates status in cache** (no network latency)
      - Returns `{ previousApplications }` context for error recovery
    - **Instant UI Response**:
      - Status changes from "traité" to "accepté"/"refusé" **instantly** in cache
      - Buttons disappear immediately (only shown when `statut === "traite"`)
      - No waiting for server response or network round-trip
    - **Rollback in `onError`**:
      - Restores snapshot with `queryClient.setQueryData()` if API fails
      - Ensures UI consistency even on errors
    - **Button locking**: `processingApplicationId` state prevents rapid clicks during async processing
  - Impact: Buttons disappear instantly after first click, making duplicate submissions impossible
  - Applied to both acceptApplicationMutation and rejectApplicationMutation
  - Architect-reviewed and validated ✅

- **Auto-Refresh Implementation**: Forms now trigger automatic UI updates in admin dashboard
  - parent-form.tsx: Added cache invalidation for `/api/parent-requests` after submission
  - nanny-form.tsx: Added cache invalidation for `/api/nanny-applications` after submission
  - All admin mutations already had `queryClient.invalidateQueries()` for proper auto-refresh
  - Impact: Admin dashboard automatically shows new candidatures/demandes without manual page refresh
  - Solves issue where 50+ submissions would require 50+ manual refreshes
  
- **Document Transfer Fix**: Documents now properly visible in employee dossiers
  - Root cause: UI was displaying `employeeApplication.documents` (undefined) instead of `selectedEmployee.documents`
  - Fixed admin.tsx to use correct variable
  - Backend already copied documents correctly (server/routes.ts)
  - Documents uploaded during candidature now appear in employee dossier after acceptance
  - E2E tested: Upload document → Submit candidature → Accept → Document visible in employee dossier ✅

### Payment Configuration System (October 20, 2025)
- **Payment Provider Management**: Administrators can now configure mobile payment providers
  - New `/admin/payment-config` page for managing payment methods
  - Support for 3 providers: Airtel Money, Moov Money, and CinetPay
  - Each provider has:
    - Activation toggle (actif/inactif status)
    - API key field (masked by default with show/hide toggle)
    - API secret field (masked by default with show/hide toggle)
    - Config JSON field for additional parameters (URLs, merchant IDs, etc.)
  - Database table `payment_configs` with fields: provider, actif, api_key, api_secret, config_json, date_modification
  - API endpoints:
    - GET `/api/payment-configs` - List all configurations
    - GET `/api/payment-configs/:provider` - Get specific provider config
    - PUT `/api/payment-configs/:provider` - Update provider configuration
  - Security features:
    - All routes protected by authentication
    - API keys masked in UI (showing only last 4 characters)
    - Secure password-type inputs with visibility toggle
  - E2E tested: Activate/deactivate providers, save configurations, verify persistence

### Admin Profile Editing (October 16, 2025)
- **Profile Edit Feature**: Administrators can now edit their own profile information
  - PUT `/api/admin/profile` - Update username, nom (full name), and email
  - Edit mode toggle with "Modifier" button in profile page
  - Form validation using `updateAdminProfileSchema` (Zod)
  - Session automatically refreshed after successful update
  - Success toast notification on save
  - E2E tested: Edit profile → Save → Verify updated values → Restore original
  - React warning fixed: moved setValue calls to useEffect

### Delete Workflows + Object Storage (October 16, 2025)
- **Deletion System**: Complete delete workflows with confirmation dialogs
  - DELETE `/api/employees/:id` - Remove employees with AlertDialog confirmation
  - DELETE `/api/nanny-applications/:id` - Remove candidatures (accepted/rejected only)
  - "Retirer l'employé" button in employee dialog (red, destructive)
  - "Supprimer la candidature" button for terminal status candidatures
  - Both deletions require explicit confirmation via AlertDialog
  - Success toasts and cache invalidation after deletion
  - E2E tested: Accept candidature → Create employee → Delete candidature → Delete employee

- **Object Storage Integration (Optional)**:
  - Disabled by default (uses base64 encoding for documents)
  - Can be enabled via `ENABLE_OBJECT_STORAGE=true` + Replit bucket creation
  - Route `/api/upload` - Stores in Object Storage or base64 based on availability
  - Route `/api/download/:path(*)` - Downloads from Object Storage
  - Legacy document handling: Documents without storedPath prefixed with "legacy-"
  - View/download functions detect legacy docs and show graceful error toasts
  - No crashes on missing/corrupted documents

- **Document Safety**: 
  - parseDocuments() ensures all documents have storedPath
  - Legacy documents (base64) never routed to Object Storage
  - viewDocument() and downloadDocument() guard against invalid paths
  - Controlled error messages instead of 404 crashes

### Accept/Reject Candidature Bug Fix (October 16, 2025)
- **Issue Fixed**: Resolved 400 error when accepting/rejecting nanny candidatures
  - Root cause: Frontend sent status values with accents ("accepté", "refusé") but backend expected unaccented values ("accepte", "refuse")
  - Fixed acceptApplicationMutation to send "accepte" instead of "accepté"
  - Fixed rejectApplicationMutation to send "refuse" instead of "refusé"
- **UI Enhancement**: Terminal statuses now displayed as colored badges
  - Accepted candidatures show green "Accepté" badge (read-only)
  - Rejected candidatures show red "Refusé" badge (read-only)
  - In-progress statuses use dropdown: "En examen", "En attente", "Traité"
  - Accept/Reject actions must use dedicated buttons (complete workflow with employee creation)
- **Payment Form Fix**: Changed all "periode" references to "motif" for consistency with backend schema
- **Testing**: E2E tests confirm Accept/Reject workflows return 200 without errors
